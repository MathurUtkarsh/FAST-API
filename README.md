# FAST API

"FastAPI" is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

It is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts. It allows for easy creation of asynchronous APIs and can handle multiple forms of request data and formats, including JSON, Form data, and files.

FastAPI is designed to be easy to use and learn, and it is easy to build web applications and APIs using FastAPI. It also includes features like automatic interactive documentation using the OpenAPI standard, dependency injection, and more.
